# ✨ Stars and Stats: Mapping the Data Behind Space Programs and Global Impact

## 🌌 Overview

**Stars and Stats** is an interactive data visualization project that explores the growing impact of space exploration on orbital debris. The site presents a series of engaging visualizations that track the rise of space debris over time, analyze the average lifespan of satellites, and break down space activity by country.

The goal is to help users of all levels understand how satellite launches, policies, and orbital events have shaped the current state of Earth's space environment.
