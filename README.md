🚀 <h1>Rocket Launch Data Visualization</h1>

📚 Overview
This project visualizes historical rocket launch data, highlighting trends in mission frequency, rocket reusability, operational longevity, space debris, launch success rates between public and private sectors, and overal global budgets for international space programs. The project leverages Flask for backend API management, Chart.js for data visualization, and SQLite to manage the rocket data. The goal is to provide an interactive and informative dashboard that allows users to explore key insights into the evolution of space launch vehicles and programs.

📊 Features & Visualizations
Mission Frequency: Total missions by rocket with active vs. retired breakdown.

Reusability vs. Expendable: Bar charts comparing reusable and expendable rockets.

Rocket Longevity: Operational lifespan of rockets, highlighting the difference between reusable and expendable designs.

Missions Over Time: Line chart depicting the number of missions over the years.

Private vs. Public: Measuring success rates on launches

Interntional Space Program Budgets: Deeper analysis on overall spend and trends from their spend. 

🤖 Ethical Considerations
Data Accuracy:
Data has been sourced from credible public sources to ensure accuracy and reliability. Care was taken to avoid any manipulation or bias while presenting the data.

Transparency:
The code, data sources, and references used in this project are clearly documented. This transparency ensures that others can validate the findings and contribute to the project.

Bias Mitigation:
Efforts were made to ensure that both active and retired rockets, as well as reusable and expendable vehicles, are represented accurately to avoid bias toward any specific space program.

Open Source Contribution:
The project is open to contributions, enabling further improvements, corrections, and enhancements by the wider community.
